# First Person Template

For USC course CTIN 406L: Sound Design for Games.

Based on Unity's [Starter Assets: Character Controllers](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-character-controllers-urp-267961) package.

This project is provided as a jumping point for your own projects, but you're not required to use it.

It also doesn't contain any audio scripts or functionality -- for audio references you may want to look at the [Roll-A-Ball-With-Audio](https://github.com/usdivad/CTIN406L_RollABallWithAudio) project.

## Instructions
1. [Download this project](https://github.com/usdivad/CTIN406L_FirstPersonTemplate/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Either:
	- Open Assets/Scenes/**Playground.unity** OR
	- Create a new scene (using File > New Scene) and use **PlaygroundTemplate** as the template
3. Add audio (and gameplay) features where you see fit / as needed for your projects!

## Dependencies
- [Unity LTS 2022.3.18f1](https://unity.com/releases/lts)
